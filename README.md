# Gothenburg Congestion Tax Calculator

Welcome to the Gothenburg Congestion Tax Calculator! This project provides a simple tool to calculate the congestion tax for vehicles in Gothenburg.

Instructions
To get started with the calculator, please follow these steps:

Ensure that you have the correct database connection configured in the appsettings.json file. Update the connection string based on your database configuration.

Create a new database with the name "Gothenburg". The application will automatically handle the database migration during runtime, so you don't need to worry about setting up the schema manually.

Run the application and start using the congestion tax calculator. It will consider the tolling station data and apply the specified rules to calculate the tax amount for each vehicle passage.

Feel free to explore the code and customize it according to your needs. If you encounter any issues or have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out for support.

Happy calculating!
